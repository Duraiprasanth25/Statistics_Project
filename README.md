## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Collection, Cleaning, and Analysis

#### **Datasets Used**
- `customer.csv`
- `credit_profiles.csv`
- `transaction.csv`

#### **Key Tasks**

##### **Data Cleaning**
- Processed **50,000 entries**, handling null values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Ensured data consistency and integrity for accurate analysis.

##### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand customer behavior.
- Identified key patterns and trends in the dataset.

##### **Data Visualization**
- Visualized **customer demographics, credit profiles, and transaction patterns**.
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for insightful graphical representations.

##### **Feature Engineering**
- Created new features to better define the target market segment.

#### **Insights**
- Customers aged **18-25** account for **26%** of the customer base.
- Average annual income of this group is **less than $50,000**.
- Limited credit history leading to lower credit scores and credit limits.
- Credit card usage is **relatively low** in this group.
- **Top shopping categories:**
  - Electronics
  - Fashion & Apparel
  - Beauty & Personal Care

### Phase 2: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

#### **Key Tasks**

##### **Statistical Measures**
- Performed **Z-tests** to validate hypotheses regarding the target market.

##### **Hypothesis Testing**
- Used the **statsmodels** libraryâ€™s `ztest` function for statistical testing.

##### **A/B Testing**
- Compared performance of **old credit card (control group)** vs **new credit card (test group)**.

#### **Results**
- **Z-score**: 2.74
- **P-value**: 0.0030
- **Significance Level**: 5%
- **Z-critical**: 1.644
- **Conclusion**: Since the **Z-score (2.74) exceeds the Z-critical value (1.644)**, and the **p-value (0.0030) is less than 0.05**, the test results are statistically significant, indicating that the new credit card outperforms the old credit card.

#### **Final Insights**
- Validated the hypothesis that the **18-25 age group represents an untapped market** for credit card usage.
- Confirmed **statistically significant differences** in transaction patterns and income levels compared to other groups.
